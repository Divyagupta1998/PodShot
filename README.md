# PodShot
## Your personal AI note taker. Watch and learn anything, leave the stress of managing notes on it.

<ins>Problem:</ins> Watching videos to learn and upskill means constantly pausing to take notes or screenshots, only to find later they’ve lost context or been forgotten. Effective note-taking demands as much focus as uninterrupted learning yet focusing on notes pulls you out of the flow, making the whole process feel clunky and inefficient. 

<ins>Solution:</ins> **PodShot!**

*PodShot is a Chrome extension that lets you:*
1. Capture key video clips with a single click, while you watch without breaking your flow 
2. Automatically transcribe those clips using AI
3. Generate instant AI-powered notes
4. Access the video from starting timestamp
5. Auto-organize everything into a Google Doc (synced straight to your Drive!)
